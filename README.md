## Project status

I use this project constantly, change words, and libs.

# About

So, I used the [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/fernando_romulo/recent) (flash cards) to learn English and Italian words. <br />
The purpose of this project is to go through the cards and find repeat words.

# Technologies
